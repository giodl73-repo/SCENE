# ASPECT

**A visualization design lab.** Named for the rubric at its centre: every good visualization presents the right aspects of its subject to its viewer.

**A**im · **S**chool · **P**recision · **E**ffect · **C**larity · **T**ruth — six dimensions, 100 points, board-ratified by ten historical persona voices.

Claude Code-driven. Markdown-first. The rubric grew from six plain dimensions to a fully structured scoring system through 300 innovations logged across 55 works — canonical imports and original designs — without a single retroactive rescore.

**Review roles:** This repo uses
[ROLES](https://github.com/giodl73-repo/ROLES), the `.roles` convention for
repository-local review panels.

## What ASPECT has done

**Reviewed 43 canonical works** spanning the full spectrum of visualization history — from Euclid's geometric proofs (~300 BCE) to Rosling's animated bubble chart (2006), from Minard's Napoleon march to the HOLC redlining maps, from Haeckel's biological illustrations to Kandinsky's abstract grammar.

**Designed 21 original works**, including a three-cycle revision experiment on antibiotic resistance visualization that pushed from 74.6 (Cycle 1) to 90.6 (Cycle 3), and a vaccines bar chart that became the first original work to beat the canonical project high (92.7 vs 91.1 for Beck).

**Confirmed 6 Advisory scores** — works that fail at the level of truth and aim, not craft. All six are confirmed advocacy-as-coercion: WWI propaganda, tobacco physician endorsements, Soviet Five-Year Plan statistics, pharmaceutical subgroup cherry-picking, partisan gerrymandering, climate denial baseline manipulation.

**Evolved the rubric 12 times** — from six plain dimensions (v1.0) to ASPECT v3.0, through 300 innovations, 21 adoption clusters, and a board ratification vote between PSYCHE(Eye) and ASPECT that the board settled 7–3.

| Minard Napoleon march (0001) | cartography + statistical | **85.5** | PASS |
| Minard Hannibal (0046) | cartography + statistical | **85.1** | PASS |
| Minard wine exports (0048) | cartography + statistical | **84.4** | PASS |

| HOLC redlining maps (0022) | advocacy + cartography | **69.2** | PASS |
| WWI propaganda poster (0049) | advocacy-visualization | **57.1** | ADVISORY |
| Tobacco physician endorsements (0051) | advocacy-visualization | **52.6** | ADVISORY |

Score range: **52.6–93.6**. Full table in [`TRACKER.md`](TRACKER.md).

The three Minard works — Napoleon (85.5), Hannibal (85.1), Wine (84.4) — are separated by at most 1.1 points. Emotional weight does not inflate scores. Data quality and dimensional completeness do.

## Key Discoveries

**Proof elegance is a real scoring variable.** The Pythagorean Chu-pei rearrangement proof (93.6) outscores Euclid's own proof of the same theorem (86.7) by 6.9 points. Both prove the same thing. The gap is in the Truth demonstrative pathway: the Chu-pei proof achieves its demonstration in one visual move; Euclid's requires a multi-step construction. Elegance of demonstration is a criterion, not an aesthetic preference.

**Advocacy-as-coercion has a six-mechanism taxonomy.** The project confirmed six mechanisms by which a visualization removes the audience's ability to verify a claim: intent to manipulate, manufactured consensus, captive source, analytical frame selection, process coercion with truthful encoding, and temporal baseline manipulation. All six Advisory scores are confirmed instances. Full taxonomy in [`scoring/CLUSTER-X-AMENDMENT.md`](scoring/CLUSTER-X-AMENDMENT.md).

**Grammar-perfect coercion is the hardest case.** The Soviet Five-Year Plan charts (0052) scored 16/20 on School and 13/15 on Precision — highest technical scores of any Advisory work. A technically excellent visualization of comprehensively false data. The gerrymandering district map (0054, 67.9) is harder still: the map is fully honest; the coercion is in the process that drew the districts.

**Ecology-as-composition is intrinsic, not decorative.** When organisms are placed at their true ecological zone boundaries in a cross-section, the density gradient IS the ecological argument. Confirmed across four works. The rubric scores ecological scene complexity at the intrinsic floor (12–14) regardless of total mark count.

**The GLASS ceiling.** Some score ceilings are data-landscape-determined, not design-determined. The antibiotic resistance work could not push past 90.6 because WHO's GLASS surveillance system lacks comparable data across all 195 countries. Designing to 95+ requires complete, comparable, well-documented records — not better design.

## How a Review Reads

Every panel has five voices: three personas chosen for school alignment and two lenses chosen for the brief's concerns. Personas disagree by design — Tufte and Neurath on Precision, Du Bois and Tufte on advocacy, Kandinsky and everyone on abstract composition. No consensus frame.

Each reviewer produces a score table across all six ASPECT dimensions, a voiced review in the persona's register, and 1–2 flagged innovations: structural techniques the current rubric does not yet name.

The SUMMARY aggregates tensions, logs innovations, and checks cluster formation. When two or more innovations point at the same rubric gap across two or more works, an amendment is proposed.

Open any `works/NNNN-slug/panel/SUMMARY.md` for a completed review. [`works/0001-napoleon-march/panel/SUMMARY.md`](works/0001-napoleon-march/panel/SUMMARY.md) is where it started: 9 innovations from the first canonical import.

## The Learning Loop

```
WORK → PANEL → INNOVATIONS → CLUSTER → AMENDMENT → NEXT WORK
```

The rubric evolves from the panel record, not by committee. Forward-only: earlier works are never rescored except during named rescore batches.

**Selected clusters and what they found:**

| Cluster | Discovery | Amendment |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| C | Founding works penalized for not being faithful to schools they invented | School Types A/B/C/D |
| G + H | Cognitive economy vs data-ink ratio; intrinsic vs additive complexity | Precision cognitive-accessibility + intrinsic-complexity types |
| I | Euclid's proofs do not report data — they demonstrate it | Truth demonstrative pathway (E1–E4) |
| K | A bar chart can apply its grammar perfectly and still be the wrong school for the story | Aim school-story match |
| N | HOLC maps presented racial classification as financial risk measurement | Truth ontological contamination dock (−3 to −8) |
| W | The density gradient of organisms at their zones IS the ecological data | Precision ecology-as-composition type |
| X | Six mechanisms by which visualization removes the audience's ability to verify | Aim coercion taxonomy + ADVISORY gate |

## The ASPECT Dimensions

| | Dimension | Pts | The question |
|-|-----------|-----|-------------|
| **A** | Aim | 15 | Does the form serve the function? Does the work take its subject seriously? |
| **S** | School | 20 | Does the work speak the grammar of its claimed school? |
| **P** | Precision | 15 | Are the marks economical, disciplined, and well-made? |
| **E** | Effect | 15 | Does the work produce its intended effect in the viewer? |
| **C** | Clarity | 15 | Can the intended audience, in the intended context, receive it? |
| **T** | Truth | 20 | Does the work faithfully represent what it claims to show? |
